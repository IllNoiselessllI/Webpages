                    <p >Ed Norton, or better the nameless character, never tells us his real name. In the Support groups he never tells hit true name, sometimes Jack and even the person closest to him don&apos; t know, or call him by his real name. even in the film he&apos; s simply referred as &quot; The Narrator&quot;. But the book describes him as a normal everyday person, a person without achievements, without special talents, basically a person simply to look over. But our narrator has a big problem: he suffers heavily from insomnia which leads him to be in a state where he doesn&apos; t know if he is sleeping or awake. He wishes to die, but not by own hand, in an accident, he even imagines it several times. The only will to survive he gains from support group until he meets Taylor Durden. </p>

                    <p >Taylor Durden is a man of action. He doesn&apos; t simply sit still and let life go past him. And with Ed he finds himself a perfect base for his organisation. Taylor is very good at motivating people with his own critical, but truly frightening true statements about life and the society of mankind.   For our narrator he is like a bright light in the darkest hour of his time. Taylor helps him to fall to his deepest point in his life, where he wanted to be, so he could rise again. But Taylor doesn&apos; t stop there he wants to show to everyone that they have potential, so he comes up with fight club and when this isn&apos;t enough anymore he realizes his project to change humanity: &quot; Project Mayhem&quot;.</p>

                        <h2>Plot</h2>
                        <p>Fight Club starts off with our nameless narrator held hostage with a gun in his mouth atop a building rigged with explosives set to go off at any moment. Starting from this dire situation, our narrator decides to tell us how he got to this point. It starts where most great stories start: testicular cancer support group. Even though our narrator attends a variety of support groups, he has no cancer. Just Issues. Apparently, going to the support groups and looking certain death in the face helps our narrator overcome his insomnia. But then a problem walks in, a problem named Marla Singer.
                        </p><p>Our narrator can&apos;t sleep when Marla Singer&aposs; around. She exposes his lies. On a business trip, our narrator takes a side trip to a nude beach where he makes a new friend: Tyler Durden. Tyler&apos;s kind of a hippie Zen philosopher type. When he gets home, our narrator discovers that his apartment has exploded. Probably he shouldn&apos;t have left the oven on. Anyway, needing a place to stay, he crashes with Tyler Durden. They go out drinking and beat the crap out of each other in a bar parking lot. You know, guy stuff. From this fateful encounter, fight club is born. </p>

                    <div class="container">
                        <p>Between fight clubs, our narrator works with Tyler on his night job as a waiter at the Pressman Hotel. There, they do things like pee in soups and spit in food. At Tyler&apos;s other job, he splices frames of pornography into children&apos;s movies. In between jobs, they steal human fat from liposuction clinics, turn it into soap, and sell it back to the rich. Meanwhile, Tyler and Marla Singer start sleeping together, much to our narrator&apos;s dismay. So she even takes away from his time with Tyler. Next, Tyler marks our narrator&apos;s hand with a chemical burn kiss caused by mixing lye and water. </p><p>From there, their subversive pranks grow into Project Mayhem, an organized effort to topple the country&apos;s social structure. Tyler recruits men from fight club to live with him, where they work on a variety of &quot; homework &quot; assignments designed to spur anarchy, like creating snarky bumper stickers or performing human sacrifices. Our narrator gets pushed to the side as Tyler takes over. Fight clubs are opening up across the country, and our narrator didn&apos;t have anything to do with it. He&apos;s feeling left out and during a pity party on the phone with Marla, he asks her what his name is. Her answer? Tyler Durden. </p>

                        <p>. From here on out, our narrator scrambles around to undo all the damage Tyler&apos;s done. He tries and fails to disband fight club. And he can only stand helplessly by as Big Bob from the testicular cancer group, now a member of Project Mayhem, is shot dead. He has only one choice: kill Tyler.   Now we&apos;re back where we started, although the perspective is a little different. We know the narrator has the gun in his own mouth. Marla, with her support group peeps in tow, races to the top of the building to tell our narrator that they can help him. Life is worth living. But he pulls the trigger anyway. </p><p>At an indeterminable time in the future, our narrator lies in a hospital bed, thinking he&apos;s in heaven. Tyler&apos;s dead. Life is worth living again. But the angels have black eyes and missing teeth and look suspiciously like a lot of the men our narrator knew from fight club. It seems that although Tyler is dead, Project Mayhem lives forever. </p>

                        <h2>Rewiew</h2>
                        <p>The book somehow opens one&apos;s mind, it shows you no glory no one-man army heroes, but an everyday person and how much he or she can affect everyone&apos;s life. The book itself is really enjoyable to read, described everything in a way so you can imagine everything in detail but not so much that the book becomes heavy to read. And through this writing style, which jumps quite often everything builds up perfectly to a turning point where the whole story makes even more sense. It was one of the best book I&apos;ve read in the last years. And definitely a reread able story.</p><p> - Emil Tauber</p>
                        <p>
                        Writing in an ironic deadpan and including something to offend everyone, Palahniuk is a risky writer who takes chances galore, especially with a particularly bizarre plot twist he throws in late in the book. Caustic, outrageous, bleakly funny, violent and always unsettling, Palahniuk&apos;s utterly original creation will make even the most jaded reader sit up and take notice. </p><p> - Publishers weekly</p><p>
                        Let&apos;s talk about Fight Club. I was borderline unhealthily obsessed with the movie version of Fight Club when I first saw it at 16. In many ways, the book is better. Fight Club deals with self-loathing, repressed impulses, and the hypocritical and meaning-starved existence many of us in the developed world feel we live in a manner which never fails to be fun, engaging, and artistic. In addition to the message, as I&apos;ve gotten older and read more novels I&apos;ve come to appreciate the style in which Fight Club is written more and more.</p><p> - Alex Bush (Amazon review)</p>
                        <p>
                        great book. Chuck Palahniuk has such a great writing style here and there are so many great little details that make this book perfect. Like in the book the narrator briefly discusses a mortician who on his wedding night made his wife soak in a tube of ice and stay there for hours and then told her to lie down and not move at all while he had sex with her. This book is a little disturbing, but it&apos;s hilarious and the main character is relatable. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read about characters who have a different perspective on society.</p><p> - Jeff (amazon review)

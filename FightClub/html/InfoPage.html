                            <p>The book takes place in the late 90&apos; but it is never really told. Still it must have played in a time between 90 and 96 because in 96, because in the book he uses several times telephones, so it must play after the 90&apos; and in 96 Chuck Palahniuk publishes the book. But there&apos;s no way to know how long the whole story actually goes because Ed Norton is unsure of how much time he has spent being Tyler.</p>

                            <h2>The Locations where the plot takes place</h2>
                            <p>They never say where it takes place, just like we never learn Edward Norton&apos; s real name. In the book he never reveals his real name even though we learned that he is called Edward Norton. So we only can speculate where it takes place. But the story might take place in Wilmington, Delaware because some of the street names are the same, and every major credit card company does have its headquarters there. Others think it is Pennsylvania. On Tyler Durden&apos; s business card, it says Paper St., Burbank. There is a Burbank in Pennsylvania. Also, you could still smoke in the bars and this movie was made after they passed all the no smoking laws on the west coast, but not yet on the east coast. Not a long drive away from Delaware though, so still makes sense about the credit card companies being close by. The film in the other hand was mainly produced in L.A. and other main locations of the book where filmed in Wilmington, California.</p>

                            <h2>Genere</h2>
                            <p>The Book Fightclub is actually a Romance but in the afterword of the 2005 Norton paperback, Chuck Palahniuk says about Fight Club&apos; s genre:&quot; One reviewer called the book science fiction. Another called it a satire on the Iron John men&apos; s movement. Another called it a satire of corporate white-collar culture. Some called it horror. No one called it a romance.&quot;</p>
                            <h2>The writing stlyle of the book</h2>
                            <p>The story is written in a style which is really is that unique to Chuck Palahniuk. He is known for repeating sentences, but changing small parts of them as the story progresses and also very crude language and subject matters it allows him to really give you an idea of how absolutely repulsive these underbelly of the world heroes are.  His use of crude writing is so good it almost makes one sick to read it. The repeated sentences show the narrator&apos; s hectic lifestyle of constant traveling, but also the character&apos; s lack of control and lack of purpose in his journey. But his probably most important technique are flashbacks. In the story completely distorts time as the narrator falls asleep and wakes up only to realize that an immense chunk of time has disappeared inexplicably.  Using flashbacks and distorting time helps create suspense and conflict in Palahniuk&apos; s writing, but it also lends itself to his style of having a large twist at the end of his novel. All of these elements come together in perfect synthesis to form a final product guaranteed to excite.</p>

                            <h2>Information about the author</h2>
                            <p >Palahniuk was born in Pasco, Washington, the son of Carol Adele and Fred Palahniuk. He has French and Ukrainian ancestry His paternal grandfather was Ukrainian and migrated to New York from Canada in 1907. Palahniuk grew up living in a mobile home in Burbank, Washington. His parents separated when he was 14 and subsequently divorced, often leaving him and his three siblings to live with their maternal grandparents at their cattle ranch in Eastern Washington. </p>
                            <p>Palahniuk began writing fiction in his mid-30s. By his account, he started writing while attending workshops for writers that were hosted by Tom Spanbauer, which he attended to meet new friends. Spanbauer largely inspired Palahniuk&apos; s minimalistic writing style. When he attempted to publish his novel, Invisible Monsters, publishers rejected it. This led him to work on his most famous novel, Fight Club, which he wrote as an attempt to disturb the publisher even more for rejecting him. Initially, Palahniuk struggled to find a literary agent and went without one until after the publication of Fight Club. </p><p>After he began receiving attention from 20th Century Fox. In 1999, three years after the novel&apos; s publication, the film adaptation by director David Fincher was released. The film was a box office disappointment and critical reaction was mixed, but a cult following soon emerged as the DVD of the film became popular upon release. </p>
